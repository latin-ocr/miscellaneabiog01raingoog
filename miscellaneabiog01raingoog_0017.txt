X PREFACE. ’

from that interesting book, “The Ancient Rites 'and
Monuments ol the Monastical and Cathedral Church of
Durham.*

“These two Bishops (Skirlaw and Langley) were the two
first founders and builders of the said cloisters, and did bear all
the charges of the building and worknranship 'of the said work,
and were the first that did cause, froin the cloister door to the
church door, to be set in glass in the window, the whole story
and miracles of that holy man St. Cuthbert, from the day of
’ his birth to his dying day. And there you might have seen
his mother lying in her child-bed, and how that after she was
delivered the bright bearns did shine from heaven unto her,
aud upon the child as he lay in the cradle, insonruch that to
every man's thinking the Holy Ghost had overshadowed him3
sor every one that did see it thought that the house had been l
all on fine, the bearns did shine so bright over all the house
both within and without, and the bishop baptised the child,
and called hirn Yulloch in the lrish tongue, in English Cuth-
bert. The bishop's name who baptized and had the keeping of
the virtuous and godly child was called Eugenius. The name
of the city where St. Cuthbert was baptised was Hardbrecunb‚
for he was blessed of God even from his mother’s wornb. So
, that every mirocle that he did after from his inlancy was set in
the said windows by itself, and under every nviracle there were
certain verses in latine, declaring the contents and meaning
thereof, in most excellent coloured glass most artificially set
forth and curiously wrought.--In the time ol King Edward
the sixth this story was pull'd down by Dean Horn and broken
all to pieces, for he could never abide any ancient monuments,
acts or deeds thot gave any light of or to godly religion.'’
