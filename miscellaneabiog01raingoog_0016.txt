is printed from e manuscript of the fourteenth century
belonging to the Dean end Chapter of York, of which a
minute account will be given in the Preface to the Three
Durham Historiam, Coldingham‚ GraystaneS, and
Chambre, which are now engaging the attention of the
Society. This piece of Biograpby hae, as a whole,
never been printed before. The Life of Cuthbert in
Capgrave, which is a conflation from various sources,
commences with the Irish origin of the saint, as detailed
in the Life before us3 and Coglan, apparently following
Capgrave, bas ascribed to him the same royal origin.
The Editor of the Life of Cutbbert, in the Acnn Sarro-
TonuM (Maroneo), enters fully into the apparent ana-
chronisms and contradictione of the whole narrative as
we give it in the following pegae, and rejects it as febu-
lous. “Certe'' says he, “Baeda nollet illustri suo
purpureo operi hos laceros assui pannoS,” upon observing
the· silence of Bede respecting the alledged royal descent
of the Saint, and thus concludes bis remarks: “servent
Hiberni suurn Nulluboc ejulantem et relinquant Anglo- ¹
Saxonibus Cuthbertum.'' This life, however, coines
within the plens of the Surtees Society asa regular
piace of biograpby‚ written in a good style, and not de-
ficient in incidental information upon subjecte connected
with the period in which it was written, and these con·
siderations have led to its publication.

It must be remarked that the Monks of Durham had
some belief in this Irish descent of Outbhert, and in
other circumstances in his history detailed in this piece
of biograpby. This is proved by the following extract
