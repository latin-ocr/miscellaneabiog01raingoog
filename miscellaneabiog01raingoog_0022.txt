os “ uulda angells” offered by our friend above to supply

·' A third Poetical Life (the Irish Lise in nerse) has
been mentioned abore, and a fourth is preserved in one
os tha manuscripts beq‘ueathed by Sir Mattheu Hele to
the Lihrary of Lincoln's Irrn.

The transcript of the Life now printed was obligingly
made for the Society by Mr Henry Tnmer, one of its
meinbars3 and the respectful thanks of the Society are
due to the Master and Fellows of University Collega
for the loan of the manuscript for this purpose.

tv. The short Lite of Bata, Bishop of Hexham, is
contained in the York manuscript above mentioned, and
as it is materially differant from the Lise of this prelate

printed in *Capgrava it has been thought worthy ota
placa in these pagos. Capgrave’s Lives are in fact mere
abridgments, and in some instances his anxiety sor com-
pression has led him to reject matter of importance.
