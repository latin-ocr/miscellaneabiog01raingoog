There is, in the British Museum,(T1rus, A. Il. 2.
3.) another copy os this Irish Life ο1 Cuthbert, as it

has been called, with a translation into Leonine verse.
The latter begins with the following lines :—

“ Si cupis audire, Cuthberti miraquescire
Virtutis mirac, potes hunc sanctum reperire.
Sanctus Cuthbertus Anglornm tutor apertus
Regis erat natus et Hybernicus est generatus, &c.’'

The Poem, however, is imperfect. A note at the
loot os sol. 151. b. disoloses this defoct, and expresses
the great anxiety of its owner on the subject. “ Hear
wants fyve leaveS, for whiche Iwold gev fyve oulde
angells.'' The Poenr ends as follows 2-

‘⁸ Dunr precibus caris devotus erun veneraris.
Terras Cuthberti quinon spoliare verentur,
Esse queant certi quod nrorte mala mor·ientur.”

There appears to be another copy ο1 this sarne Poeti-
cal Life in the MS. Harl. 4843, 1. 161.

ΙΙΙ. The next piece, the Life os St. Cuthbert in sim-
ple Leouinea* is transcribed from a manuscript [Ι. 21.
165] belonging to the Master and Fellows ο1 University
College, Oxford, written about the end of the ruth or

beginning of the 13th century, and containing, besides²
1. Bede’s Prose Life ο1 St. Cuthbert.
